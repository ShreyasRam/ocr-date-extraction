# ocr-date-extraction

I have implemented this project using Python. I have used a combination of tesseract ocr library and regular expressions to detect and extract the expense dates. Some of the images were performing better without any preprocessing hence i made it a two step process where in an image returning a null value at the first step was subjected to further preprocessing.
